## Factor variables

Let us continue to use the mtcars (Motor Cars) dataset. Recall we had the correlation matrix as a guide/EDA. 

```{r warning=F}
str(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
mtcarscor = cor(mtcars) # get the correlation matrix between all numerical variables.
mtcarscor
loadPkg("corrplot")
corrplot.mixed(mtcarscor)
unloadPkg("corrplot")
```

From the help menu, we can see that the variables are: 

* `mpg`: Miles/(US) gallon
* `cyl`: Number of cylinders
* `disp`: Displacement (cu.in.)
* `hp`: Gross horsepower
* `drat`: Rear axle ratio
* `wt`: Weight (1000 lbs)
* `qsec`: 1/4 mile time
* `vs`: Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)
* `am`: Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
* `gear`: Number of forward gears
* `carb`: Number of carburetors

The current structure of the dataframe has all variables data type recorded 
as `num`. But one can argue they should be re-classified as: 

* Quantitative: `mpg`, `disp`, `hp`, `drat`, `wt`, `qsec`
* Depends: `cyl`, `gear`, `carb`
* Qualitative/Categorical: `vs`, `am`

For our purpose here, let us convert these five as categorical: `cyl`, `gear`, 
`carb`, `vs`, `am`. Let us also take a look at the structure of the dataframe 
before and after the conversion. (Not shown in html, but from console execution.) 
We will save the new dataframe with categorical variables `mtc`.

```{r}
str(mtcars)
mtc <- mtcars
mtc$cyl = factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtc$gear = factor(mtcars$gear)
mtc$carb = factor(mtcars$carb)
mtc$vs = factor(mtcars$vs)
mtc$am = factor(mtcars$am)
str(mtc)
```

Here, the levels of the factor variables are set with alpha-numeric order. 
In other cases, if the such order is not what we want, we can specify them 
when converting.

```{r}
mtc$cyl = factor(mtcars$cyl, levels = c("4","6","8"))
mtc$gear = factor(mtcars$gear, levels = c("3","4","5"))
mtc$carb = factor(mtcars$carb, levels = c("1","2","3","4","5","6"))
mtc$vs = factor(mtcars$vs, levels = c("1","0"))
mtc$am = factor(mtcars$am, levels = c("0","1"))
str(mtc)
```

First, notice that in R, once the we converted a variable to factor, the recorded 
values are now strings. For example, `cyl` now has values "6", "6", "4", "6",...
(NOT 2, 2, 1, 2, ..., NOR 6, 6, 4, 6,...). 


So, can we still talk about the correlation coefficient between a quantitative 
and a categorical data? The answer is  

> **NO** and **YES**

### Pearsons vs Spearman  
If we try to calculate correlation coefficient between one numeric and one 
categorical variable, the `cor()` function will throw an error. For example:  
`cor(mtc$disp,mtc$cyl)`  
results in "Error in cor(mtc\$disp, mtc\$cyl) : 'y' must be numeric".

Since `mtc$cyl` values are just "1", "2", and "3" now, we can still calculate 
something like a regular correlation coefficient:  
`cor(mtc$disp,as.numeric(mtc$cyl))` = `r cor(mtc$disp,as.numeric(mtc$cyl))`  
which is the result we took last time without thinking much about it. You can 
also find this correlation coefficient in the `corrplot()` table before we 
convert to categorical. Recall that scaling, or shifting, does not change the 
correlation coefficient.

But does this make sense to use it between numeric and categorical variables?

Read the article here:  
Hauke,J. & Kossowski,T.(2011). [Comparison of Values of Pearson's and Spearman's 
Correlation Coefficients on the Same Sets of Data. 
Quaestiones Geographicae, 30(2) 87-93](https://doi.org/10.2478/v10117-011-0021-1).

In essence, when one variable is ordinal, or not normal (distributed), it is 
better to use the spearman method than the default "pearson" method.  
In our case, comparing the two results, we find:  
`cor(mtc$disp,as.numeric(mtc$cyl), method="pearson")` = `r cor(mtc$disp,as.numeric(mtc$cyl), method="pearson")`  
`cor(mtc$disp,as.numeric(mtc$cyl), method="spearman")` = `r cor(mtc$disp,as.numeric(mtc$cyl), method="spearman")`  

The same set of choices is available for the correlation test function 
`cor.test()`. As an example, the **pearson** (default) method yields :  
```{r results='markup'}
cor.test(mtc$disp,as.numeric(mtc$cyl), method="pearson")
```  
while the **spearman** gives
```{r results='markup'}
cor.test(mtc$disp,as.numeric(mtc$cyl), method="spearman")
```  


We were a little sloppy in last week's work and basically used pearson's method 
for all pairs of correlation coefficients. We can fix our mistakes when we have 
time.

### LM with num + factor predictors

Last time, we built model 3 (`fit3`) involving `cyl` which is now restated as 
a factor variable. How does that change our results? Let us compare them. 
First, similar to last week, we will crate a simple version:

```{r}
fit2 <- lm(mpg ~ wt+cyl, data = mtcars)
summary(fit2)
```

```{r results='markup'}
xkabledply(fit2, title = paste("Model (num):", format(formula(fit2)) ) )
xkablevif(fit2)
```

The multiple-$r^2$ value for this model `fit2` is `r summary(fit2)$r.squared `.

Next we will use `cyl` as factor variable.  In such cases, each **level** will get a coefficient from the model fitting. If the "base" level can be absorbed in another coefficient, it will then be assigned as zero. 
 
```{r}
catfit2 <- lm(mpg ~ wt+cyl, data = mtc)
summary(catfit2)
```


```{r results='markup'}
xkabledply(catfit2, title = paste("Model (factor):", format(formula(catfit2)) ) )
```

And the multiple-$r^2$ value for this model `catfit2` is `r summary(catfit2)$r.squared `.

How do we interpret these results? 

 * Where is `cyl4`?
 * Is the new model just "one" model or "three" models?

We should write down the newest model on a line. (Will do that on OneNote in class.) 
OR, we can write down the model as three lines (three models)  
cyl 4: mpg = 33.99 -  0   - 3.21 * wt      
cyl 6: mpg = 33.99 - 4.26 - 3.21 * wt      
cyl 8: mpg = 33.99 - 6.07 - 3.21 * wt      

They are the same as (just a random example here)  
cyl 4: mpg = 35.99 - 2.00 - 3.21 * wt    
cyl 6: mpg = 35.99 - 6.26 - 3.21 * wt      
cyl 8: mpg = 35.99 - 8.07 - 3.21 * wt     

To avoid such arbitrary assignment, the base level is assumed zero whenever it 
can be absorbed in other coefficient.

The similar results and features for more variables:

```{r}
fit3 <- lm(mpg ~ wt+disp+cyl, data = mtcars)
summary(fit3)
```
```{r results='markup'}
xkabledply(fit3, title = paste("Model (num):", format(formula(fit3)) ) )
xkablevif(fit3)
```

The multiple-$r^2$ value for this model (all numeric) `fit3` is `r summary(fit3)$r.squared `.

Then we use `cyl` as factor variable.   
 
```{r}
catfit3 <- lm(mpg ~ wt+disp+cyl, data = mtc)
summary(catfit3)
```

```{r results='markup'}
xkabledply(catfit3, title = paste("Model (factor):", format(formula(catfit3)) ) )
xkablevif(catfit3)
```

And the multiple-$r^2$ value for this model `catfit3` is `r summary(catfit3)$r.squared `.

We can also compare the plots. First the previous results (numeric variables):  
```{r}
plot(fit3)
```

And then the new results (factor variable).
```{r}
plot(catfit3)
```


## Interaction terms (numeric variables)

We will now allow interaction terms in our models. Will only include numerical 
variables here at first. We will try one with `qsec` which has a weak 
correlation with `wt`.

```{r}
mixfit2 <- lm(mpg ~ (wt+disp+qsec)^2, data = mtcars)
summary(mixfit2)
```

```{r results='markup'}
xkabledply(mixfit2, title = "Model w/interaction: degree 2 in wt, disp, qsec")
xkablevif(mixfit2)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# plot(mixfit2)
```

And the multiple-$r^2$ value for this model `mixfit2` is 
`r summary(mixfit2)$r.squared `. It continues to get better, but this is 
simply a known fact that $r^2$ will improve with the number of predictors. The 
coefficient p-values tell a very story in terms of model accuracy. 

Try another one of degree 3.This time, let us include `hp` instead of `qsec`, 
which has a strong correlation with `wt`.

```{r}
mixfit3 <- lm(mpg ~ (wt+disp+hp)^3, data = mtcars)
summary(mixfit3)
```

```{r results='markup'}
xkabledply(mixfit3, title = "Model w/interaction: degree 3 in wt, disp, hp")
xkablevif(mixfit3)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# plot(mixfit3)
```

And the multiple-$r^2$ value for this model `mixfit3` is 
`r summary(mixfit3)$r.squared `. Again, the $r^2$ improvement means very little 
while the 
coefficient p-values are rather dismal. 

To compare all these models nonetheless, let us also include the base model we 
tried previously `mpg ~ wt` (as fit1). The anova results is:

```{r}
fit1 <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
summary(fit1)
# vif(fit1)
```

```{r results='markup'}
anova(fit1,fit3,catfit3,mixfit3) -> anovaRes
anovaRes
#str(anovaRes)
```

And a nicer display of the anova result table is here:  
```{r results='markup'}
xkabledply(anovaRes, title = "ANOVA comparison between the models")
```

Recall that the table shows the step-by-step Residual DF, Residual SS, as well as *REDUCTION* in DF and Sum of Sq. The last two columns show the F-Statistics and p-values of the anova test (between the current and previous rows). 



## Interaction with num and factor vars

The concepts above can be extended naturally to models with interactions between numeric and factor variables. Let us try a few here.  

```{r results='markup'}
str(mtc)
mixcatfit1 = lm(mpg ~ wt*cyl, data = mtc)
xkabledply(mixcatfit1, title = paste("Model:", format(formula(mixcatfit1)) ) )
```  

Is the result what you expect?  Again, we can interpret this as one complex model, 
or three simpler models:   
cyl 4: mpg = 39.57 -  0    - (5.65 - 0) * wt      
cyl 6: mpg = 39.57 - 11.16 - (5.65 - 2.87) * wt      
cyl 8: mpg = 39.57 - 15.70 - (5.65 - 3.45) * wt      

Putting it in another way, the term `cyl` will allow the three models (three cases)
to have different intercepts. The (interaction) term `cyl:wt` will allow the 
three models to have three different slopes for `wt` in the linear model.

Let us try another one. Is the result what you expect?  

```{r results='markup'}
mixcatfit2 = lm(mpg ~ wt*cyl + cyl:hp, data = mtc)
xkabledply(mixcatfit2,title = paste("Model:", format(formula(mixcatfit2)) ) )
```

Why is there a `cyl4:hp` term??  

Okay, one last with factor:factor.  

```{r results='markup'}
mixcatfit3 = lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl*gear, data = mtc)
# xkabledply(mixcatfit3, title = paste("Model:", format(formula(mixcatfit3)) ) )
xkabledply(mtcarscor)
```

Again, is the result what you expect? Why isn't there a term for `cyl8:gear4`?

Afterall, interaction between two factor variable simply introduces (m x n) 
"intercepts" for the (m x n) scenarios.


```{r results='markup'}
# check
xkabledply( table(mtc$cyl,mtc$gear), title = "Contingency table: gear vs cyl" )
```

```{r}
# also check directly:
sub84 = subset(mtc, cyl=="8" & gear=="4")
nrow(sub84)
sub83 = subset(mtc, cyl=="8" & gear=="3")
nrow(sub83)
```
